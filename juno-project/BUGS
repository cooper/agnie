Bugs

14 Oct 2014

[ ] Pretty sure that user modes must be equal on all servers for some reason.

[ ] SQUIT cannot stop a connection timer by server name wildcards, but it can disconnect
    servers matching wildcards. therefore it is confusing since that only works sometimes.

Cleanup

[ ] Why is the NAMES command in channel.pm?

[ ] channel handle_privmsgnotice() is just a mess. needs more events.

[ ] user mode handler uses ridiculous regex, needs to work just like the newer
    channel mode handler.

[ ] WHO command is a mess, but it works.
